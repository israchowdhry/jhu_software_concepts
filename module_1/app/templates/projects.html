    <h3>Module 1: Personal Website</h3>

    <p>
      This project is to help understand the fundamentals of website contructions.
      This is done by using a Flask-based personal website built using
      HTML templates, CSS styling, and Python. This website includes three main
        pages: home, projects, and contact.
